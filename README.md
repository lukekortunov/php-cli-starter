# Starter for PHP CLI tools

This starter is a wrapper for `symfony/console` and `php-di/php-di`.

It allows you to create CLI applications rapidly, literally in few minutes.

Also you may build whole application by running `php ./build/build.php` into `phar` archive

Example (Command located in src/App/Command/ExampleHelloWorld.php):
```shell
$ cd src
$ php app.php example:hello-world
```
